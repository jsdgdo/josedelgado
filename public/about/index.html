      <h1>The fun is in figuring it out</h1>
      <p>Always gravitating toward design since the begining of my career in software, starting as a developer, the web gave me the outlook and the tools to express myself in a visual and interactive way. Armed with semantic HTML, Javascript, and most of all CSS, my journey in design started to take shape. </p>
      <p>First in the browser and then into Sketch & Figma, the way I learned to design let me onto further levels of abstraction but always keeping in mind the needs of my fellow engineers. </p>
      <p>Hitting the grownd running I got to be a part of an agency, then helped building an online presence for 3 of the most read dailies in the country, after that I was designing expriences for an exciting startup. I’m eating it all up and learning every day.</p> 
      <p>As oppossed to traditional learning structures (two-time college dropout here) I find that the best way to learn for me is through exprience and lots of reading and research, my intuition and experience fill the gaps successfully. </p>
      <p>Work samples and case studies are coming soon, for now if you want to know more about my work shoot me an email! I’d love to have a chat.</p>
